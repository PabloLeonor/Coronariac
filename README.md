# Coronariac (under development, Version 0.1 non working yet)
Coronariac is an emulator of CARDIAC but, what is CARDIAC?
Cardiac is a paper computer.Yes! its an actual computer made of paper! , but, how does a paper computer works? well its actually powered by you, but this doesnt make it less interesting...
It was designed by bell labs to teach how computers work back in the 60's, this project is an emulator of this computer developed in java.

At the moment, the emulator is capable of:
  
  Program the memory in the memory sheet
  
  Save the memory into a file to your pc
