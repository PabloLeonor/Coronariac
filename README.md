# Coronariac (VERSION 1 SPANISH)
Coronariac is an emulator of CARDIAC but, what is CARDIAC?
Cardiac is a paper computer.Yes! its an actual computer made of paper! , but, how does a paper computer works? well its actually powered by you, but this doesnt make it less interesting...
It was designed by bell labs to teach how computers work back in the 60's, this project is an emulator of this computer developed in java. ONLY FOR JAVA SE 22 AND UP!

The emulator is almost done!

  Here is a simple adding program from official Cardiac's mannual:
  
  0 034 [load the first number from imput and store it in the memory adress 34]
  
  1 035 [load the second number from imput and store it in the memory adress 35]
  
  1 134 [clear the accumulator and load the content of the adress 34 as the first numer to add]
  
  3 235 [add the contents of the adress 35 as the second number and add it]
  
  4 636 [the result of the adding will be stored in the memory adress 36]
  
  5 536 [the contents of the memory adress 36 will now be shown in the output]
  
  6 900 [stops the machine]

  to use it, you should do first load the file "Entrada.tjd" ,tjd stands for "TarJeta de Datos"-> "data card"

  Write this in coronariac's memory sheet and press [program] button, then step the machine using the [step] for execute every cycle of the adding program
